# üìä CLV-LTV Analysis

This repository contains analyses and tools to compute **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** and **Lifetime Value (LTV)** from customer/order data.  
It includes data cleaning, exploratory analyses, and visualizations using Jupyter Notebooks, as well as sample datasets.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** All CSV files included in this repository contain **sample data** only, provided for demonstration and educational purposes.

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AhmadShamayl/CLV-LTV-Analysis.git
   cd CLV-LTV-Analysis
(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Data_CLV_Analysis.ipynb
or launch via JupyterLab.

Run through the notebook cells to perform:

data loading

cleaning

CLV/LTV computations

visualizations

insights extraction

üìå Features
Data cleaning steps for real-world customer/order and session datasets

Compute Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using purchase history

Exploratory data analysis to spot customer behavior trends

Visualize retention, churn, purchase frequency, cohort analysis

Explore session vs email behavior (from Smartlook data)

‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats & Next Steps
Data is sample / anonymized; in real applications, additional privacy & data ethics considerations might apply.

Currently focused on historical data analysis.

Future work could include:

predictive modeling (forecasting CLV)

customer segmentation

integration of marketing spend data

More robust handling of missing data, outliers, and validation would improve results.
